"""
Write a Python function that calculates the sum of a list of numbers:

The function should accept a list of numbers and return the sum of those numbers.
If no argument is provided (that is, numbers is None), return the sum of the numbers 1 to 100 
(Note that this is not the same as an empty list of numbers being passed in. In that case the sum returned will be 0).
