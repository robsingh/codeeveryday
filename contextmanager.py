"""
Write a context manager to roll back a transaction on the given Account class.

There are two special (aka dunder) methods you need to define to create a context manager.

The purpose of the context manager is to roll back any transaction that will make the balance go below 0 (debt != cool). 

Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
